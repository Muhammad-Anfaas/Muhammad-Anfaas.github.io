      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;linux-for-development&#34;&gt;Linux for Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unix-based systems have long held a competitive edge over Windows when it comes to development. While WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) allows Windows users to tap into Linux’s power, persistent bugs and quirks can slow you down. Virtual machines like VMware are an alternative, but they often come with performance trade-offs. For developers who want reliability, speed, and full control, dual-booting Linux alongside Windows remains the ultimate solution.
Since Linux comes in different distributions and flavors, the standout contender for developers is Ubuntu. It offers a perfect balance of efficiency, stability, and user-friendliness, making it ideal for both beginners and advanced users.
In this blog, we will walk you through the process of installing Ubuntu alongside Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
