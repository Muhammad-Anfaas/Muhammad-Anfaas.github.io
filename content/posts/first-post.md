# Who Am I?
---

## Why This Blog Exists

I learn better when I explain things.

Instead of passively consuming tutorials, I want to:
- Document what I learn
- Break down concepts in my own words
- Build projects and analyze them
- Track my growth publicly

Think of this as a structured engineering notebook.

## What You’ll Find Here

I’ll be writing about:

- Programming fundamentals
- Algorithms & data structures
- Systems concepts
- Linux & terminal workflows
- Tools I use (Hugo, Git, etc.)
- Lessons from real projects

Some posts will be beginner-friendly.
Some will be deeply technical.

All of them will be honest.

## The Goal

Not followers.
Not aesthetics.

Clarity.
Skill.
Depth.

If you’re on a similar path — welcome.

Let’s build properly.
